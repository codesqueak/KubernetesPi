# Kubernetes Raspberry Pi Cluster

This guide covers the construction, installation and use of a Kubernetes Cluster hosted on a set of Raspbeey Pi computers.

## Hardware

A minimum configuration to demonstrate the features of Kubernetes is as follows:

| Item | Use | Example | Quantity |Notes | 
|------|-----|---------|--------|---|
| Nodes | Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+   | [Amazon Link](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Raspberry-Pi-Model-64-Bit-Processor/dp/B07BDR5PDW) | 4 |Use a model with 1GB RAM and Quad Core CPU | 
| Power | Anker PowerPort 60 W 6-Port  | [Amazon Link](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Anker-PowerPort-Family-Sized-Technology-Smartphones-Black/dp/B00PK1IIJY)  |  1    |   | 
| USB Cables | Power to Pi's    | [Amazon Link](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00OOOHPN8) |   1 Pack       | Need 5      | 
| Switch   | Network / 8 ports |  [Amazon Link](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00AWM7PKO) |  1      |        | 
| Ethernet Cables  | Network |  [Amazon Link](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B01LF80T4M) | 1 Pack       | Need 5      | 
| USB to 12 Converter  | Switch Power    |    [Amazon Link](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B071X6VYXR)    |   1     | Note 1      | 

*Note 1* The 5V to 12V cable is just to make things tidier.  You can use the original 12V PSU for the switch.
